_Task: Find [user.txt](#user-flag) and [root.txt](#root-flag)_

## Penetration Methodologies

__Scanning__

- nmap

__Enumeration__

- dirbuster

__Exploitation__

- Known CVE (ona)

__Priv Esc__

- Port Forwarding

- GTFOBins

This was my first “start-to-finish” CTF challenge, and I learned a ton of new techniques and tools as I slowly picked my way through the box. As my first rooted machine, this was challenging, and I’m sure others will find success much faster than myself. Regardless, I wanted to take this opportunity to capture my methods and thought processes as I begin to delve into the CTF realm, while hopefully helping those struggling to find the next step. 

## User Flag

We start by scanning the _OpenAdmin_ machine using nmap. I generally output my scan to a text file for portability and easier access later. 

- __sV__: version and service on the port 

- __A__: the OS version and other things

- __O__: remote OS detection using fingerprinting

- __script=banner__: banner information

Two ports came back open, port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP). Port 80 indicated to me that this machine is a webserver. Without the information already being available to me on the HackTheBox webpage, I can also infer that this is a Linux machine based on the results. Since I don’t have any usernames or passwords, SSH doesn’t seem like the best route right now, so let's focus our attention on the webserver.

```bash
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
```

We'll navigate to the web page successfully. The machine is hosting Apache2 and is currently displaying the default page for its home: 

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/webpage.PNG)

With some research, we can find there are a few tools available to enumerate webserver directories. One being `DirBuster`, which can brute-force directories. Let's boot it up, add the target URL, and select the directory-list-1.0. The `list info` button can provide good information on which list is appropriate. Once we have our settings, we'll press start:

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/dirb1.PNG)

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/dirb2.PNG)

Pretty quickly the results start to come in and we can see that one link is not standard. `/ona` looks promising and received a 200 response, which indicates a successful HTTP request. Ona is the home directory for a project called [OpenNetAdmin](https://github.com/opennetadmin/ona). At this point, we can pause DirBuster and navigate to `http://10.10.10.171/ona/` to see what we can find:
 
![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/ona.PNG)
 
Okay, we now have a bit of a peak behind the curtain, and one thing on this page really stands out: we now know their current version number for ona, and it looks like it may be unpatched. At this point, we can search metasploit for opennetadmin 18.1. Our search returns a single exploit, a ping command injection:

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/meta1.PNG)
 
Our next step is to determine if this exploit will work in this specific scenario, so we'll run the options command to view a more detailed synopsis. We can see that the version running on the machine falls within the vulnerable versions:

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/meta2.PNG)
 
Okay, everything looks to be in order, we'll build out our exploit, setting the target host and selecting the linux meterpreter payload.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/meta3.PNG)
 
When we run the exploit, we can see it create a meterpreter session. Success! We have now gained a foothold within the machine. Now to see if we can find anything of use. Primarily, we know we need to find a way to escalate my privileges. Within the context of these HackTheBox CTFs, that means gaining access to a user account first.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/meta4.PNG)

After getting our bearings, we'll open a shell session from meterpreter. we'll cat `/etc/passwd`, which reveals a list of users. The two that we will make note of are jimmy and joanna.

```
jimmy:x:1000:1000:jimmy:/home/jimmy:/bin/bash
joanna:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/joanna:/bin/bash
```

While enumerating the file system, we find a file named `database_settings.inc.php` within the `/config` folder. When I open it I find a password for the database: n1nj4W4rri0R!. 

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/db.PNG)
 
We'll take note of the password. Since many people reuse passwords across services, it’s worth an attempt to see if johnny or joanna have done the same. 
 
From our scan earlier, we noted that port 22, SSH, was also open. We have a couple usernames, and we have a potential password, it’s time to see if we can establish an SSH connection. 
 
We can successfully connect with user jimmy first! We have escalated privileges. The first flag on the HackTheBox machines are within the user’s home folder, so let's check jimmy’s, with no luck. We need to gain access to the user joanna.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/ssh.PNG)
 
Next, we'll run the `netstat` command and find that the _OpenAdmin_ machine is hosting something on `127.0.0.1:52846`. We should try to gain access to this service. 

```
tcp	0	0 127.0.0.1:52846	0.0.0.0:*	LISTEN
``` 
  
We need to accomplish remote port forwarding. By utilizing SSH tunneling, we can access the port on _OpenAdmin_ remotely. I learned a lot about this topic from [linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-ssh-tunneling/).

```bash
$ ssh -L 52846:localhost:52846 jimmy@10.10.10.171
```

Next, we'll open my web browser and navigate to `localhost:52846`. We connect successfully, but it looks like jimmy took extra precautions, the page appears to be protected by a login.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/login.PNG)

We may recall seeing some unrelated webpages when we were poking around on the SSH session as jimmy before. Let's look at this file again to see if it has something that could help us out here. Using the `find` command, we locate a `index.php` in the `/www/internal` directory and view it. 
 
Within the `index.php` file we find the html `<div>` tag containing the login form. This form has an embedded php script that checks the login and password directly, and we can plainly see the login and the hashed password, which is hashed with with SHA512. 
 
![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/hash.PNG)
 
Let's grab the password hash and navigate to a website that can crack SHA512 hashes, hoping that the password isn’t too complex. Fortunately, the password is quickly "Revealed".

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/revealed.PNG)
 
We'll return to the index page and attempt the username, jimmy, and the new password. 
 
We successfully log in, where we find an RSA private key, presumedly belonging to joanna, for whatever reason. We'll copy the RSA key to a text file.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/rsa.PNG)
 
To use this key, we'll start with `ssh2john.py` to hash the newly attained RSA key and then use `john` in conjunction with the word list `rockyou.txt` to crack the pass phrase bloodninjas.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/john1.PNG)

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/john2.PNG)
 
Before attempting to SSH, we need to change the permissions on the text file containing the private RSA key. 

```bash
$ chmod 600 rsa_key.txt
```

Now, we are ready to attempt to connect to the machine with user joanna; we have a username, potentially a key, and a passphrase. We attempt SSH, and success! We're now connected as joanna.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/ssh2.PNG)
 
Let's grab the first flag from joanna’s home directory. Now on to root!
 
![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/user-flag.PNG)

## Root Flag

Now that we are connected as joanna, we'll run the command `sudo -l`, which lists the user’s allowed commands and privileges. In this case, joanna can run the `/bin/nano` command on the `/opt/priv` text file as root, without root’s password. 
 
We'll run the command with sudo, and find ourselves within a text file, with potentially escalated privileges.

![](/assets/img/posts/htb/03-2020/sudo2.PNG)
 
Using [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), a “curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions”, we may be able to spawn a shell with escalated privileges. We'll attempt the commands from the site within the nano session:

```bash
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

Success! It’s difficult to see, but we successfully spawned a shell session. We can now grab the final flag and complete _OpenAdmin_!

## Mitigations

- Security through obscurity is not a best practice. If a network administration tool like ONA must be public facing it should be secured through consistent updates. Enumerating directories is a simple task for an attacker and finding hidden directories is not difficult. 

- Password re-use can have some unintended consequences. For example, password for a database should not be the same as the password used to remotely connect to a system, especially when that password can be found in cleartext on the system. A good password policy can help prevent this.

- Allowing users to be able to run certain commands with elevated privileges should be carefully considered. It might be necessary for a user to perform a duty and does comply with the principle of Least Privileged, but as [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) demonstrates, it can be abused.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this box and I learned a ton. It was slow going at times, but I feel that I will certainly use the techniques I covered here going forward. The range of tools and concepts required to root this box was certainly beneficial and seeing some of them in action really drove their purpose home.
